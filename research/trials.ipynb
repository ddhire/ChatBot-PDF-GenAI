Tobacco\\nuse is a risk factor for six of the eight leading causes of death. In India, 8-9 lakh persons die every\\nyear due to tobacco related diseases. At present, India is in the second stage of tobacco epidemic.\\nThere is an urgent need to reverse this entirely preventable epidemic. India faces huge challenge of\\ntobacco control in view of high prevalence of tobacco use, as revealed by Global Adult Tobacco\\nSurvey (GATS) India 2010. With more than one third of adult population using large number of\\ntobacco products, it becomes imperative to implement effective tobacco control strategies. The\\nGATS India 2010 also revealed that there is demand for assistance to quit tobacco use in the\\ncommunity. It is a well established fact that in view of highly addictive nature of nicotine contained\\nin tobacco, the tobacco users need assistance and treatment. The treatment for tobacco dependence\\nmay be in the form of behavioral counseling or pharmacotherapy.\\nThe benefits of treatment for tobacco dependence have also been well documented. World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) has recommended âBrief Interventionâ for tobacco cessation, which can\\nbe provided in different health care delivery settings. Studies have shown that people who quit\\ntobacco live longer than people who continue to use tobacco. From the moment someone quit\\nsmoking, it only takes 20 minutes for the body to start undergoing beneficial changes. Thus cessation\\nof tobacco use has extensive benefits and there is a need to make cessation facilities widely available.\\nThe âTobacco Dependence Treatment Guidelinesâ have been developed recognizing the need for\\nprofessional help to tobacco users to quit. It is imperative that these guidelines are widely distributed\\nto reach all relevant stakeholders to ensure maximum output in terms of reduction of tobacco use.\\nThe document has been divided in to four sections to make it user friendly.\\nDr R. K. Srivastava'),\n",

[1]  Tobacco is also one of\\nthe major causes of deaths and diseases in India, accounting for almost a million deaths every\\nyear. [2]\\nGlobal Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) India (2010) data revealed that more than one out of three\\nadults in India (35%) used tobacco in some form or the other. Among them, 21 % of adults used only\\nsmokeless tobacco, 9% only smoked and 5 % smoked as well as used smokeless tobacco. Overall\\ntobacco use is much higher among Indian males at 48 percent but is also a serious concern among\\nfemales among whom prevalence is 20 per cent.\\n[3]\\nIn India, khaini or tobacco-lime mixture (12%) is the most commonly used smokeless tobacco\\nproduct, followed by gutkha  ( a mixture of  tobacco, lime and areca nut) (8%), betel quid with tobacco\\n(6%) and tobacco dentifrice (5%). [3] Bidi (9%) is most commonly used smoking product, followed by\\ncigarette (6%) and hukkah (1%). [3]\\nAs per the Global Health Professions Student Survey (GHPSS), India, 2009, 6.5% third year dental\\nstudents smoked cigarettes and 8.6% used other tobacco products. [4] Among medical students, 13.4%\\nthird year medical students smoked cigarettes and 11.6% used other tobacco products. [4] Global\\nYouth Tobacco Survey(GYTS) India, 2009 revealed that 14.6% of 13-15 years school going children in\\nIndia used tobacco products out of which 4.4%  smoked cigarettes and 12.5% used other forms of\\ntobacco.\\n[5] These figures are alarming because these professional students will themselves lead the\\nwar against tobacco, and because earlier initiation increases chances of long term dependence.\\nArticle 14 of WHO FCTC (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) prescribes demand reduction\\nmeasures concerning tobacco dependence and cessation. It states that âeach party (country) shall\\ndevelop and disseminate appropriate, comprehensive and integrated guidelines based on scientific\\nevidence and best practices, taking in to account national circumstances and priorities, and shall\\ntake effective measures to promote cessation of tobacco use and adequate treatment for tobacco\\ndependenceâ.\\nTo help countries fulfill the obligations under FCTC, WHO has established MPOWER, the policies\\nof which are proven to reduce tobacco use\\nM â Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies.\\nP â Protect people from tobacco smoke.\\nO â Offer help to quit tobacco use.\\nW â Warn about the dangers of tobacco.\\nE â Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.\\nR â Raise taxes on tobacco.\\nIndia is a signatory to the FCTC. The Government of India passed the Cigarettes and Other\\nTobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production,\\nSupply and Distribution) Act in 2003.  Under National Tobacco Control Programme, being implemented\\nin the XI Five Year Plan,  cessation facilities are being made available at the district hospital level.'),\n",

(ICD â 10)\\nBoth smoked and smokeless forms of tobacco contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical,\\nmaking it difficult for habituated tobacco users to quit.\\n[6][7] In fact, it is as addictive, or even more,\\nthan heroin or cocaine. Over time, users become dependent on nicotine and suddenly stopping\\nproduces both physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms. [8][9][10][11]\\nNicotine is readily absorbed from the respiratory tract, buccal mucosa and skin. [12] There is\\nminimal absorption through the gastrointestinal tract when administered orally.  Cigarettes are highly\\neffective mechanism for delivering nicotine.  Inhaled nicotine takes about 10-19 seconds to reach\\nthe brain and its stimulation releases chemicals which ensure feeling of goodness, alertness and\\nenergy.\\n[6][7][9]\\nAs the person stops tobacco use, these chemicals decrease in the body and withdrawal symptoms\\nstart. These can be very distressing for the unprepared tobacco user. Thus, the tobacco user is\\ncompelled to continue using tobacco, hence trapped in the vicious cycle.\\nStudies have shown that tobacco users must effectively deal with both the physical and\\npsychological symptoms of withdrawal to quit and stay quit.

Every 6 .5 seconds one tobacco user \\ndies from a tobacco-related disease somewhere in the world.  \\nOne third of the Indian population consumes some form of tobacco. This addiction is deep \\nrooted and presents differently across the cou ntry. Evidence from GATS -2 Survey presents \\n55.4% Smokers and 49.7% Smokeless tobacco users are interested or planning to quit the \\naddiction.  \\nIndia has been in the forefront of tobacco control activities and played a leadership role in \\nbringing region specific issues like smokeless tobacco into the fray. Government of India has \\nmade tremendous strides in tobacco control efforts by implementing various initiatives from \\nAdvocacy leading to the signing and ratification of the WHO Framework Convention on \\nTobacco Control (FCTC) in 2004; conducting the Global Youth and Adult Tobacco Surveys.  \\nThe recognition of associations between tobacco use and oral health, as well as the benefits \\nof tobacco cessation on oral health outcomes makes it imperative for national ora l health \\nprogrammes to actively support tobacco control efforts at both the clinical and community \\nlevels. The National Oral Health Program (NOHP) under the Ministry of Health and Family \\nWelfare, Govt. of India  reinitiated its activities in 2014 and has ma de rapid developments in \\npromoting oral health across the country and strengthened systems. In order to generate \\nevidence that could be translated to policies the NOHP proposed and now is developing \\nNational Resource Centres across the country by partnerin g with imminent Dental \\nInstitutions who could support and translate evidence to policies. Further building resource \\ncapacities at national level is another important goal of National Resource Centres.  \\nThe National Resource Centre for Oral Health & Tobacco  Cessation was established by at  \\nMAIDS with support from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , Government of India \\nand Department of Health and Family Welfare Government of Delhi.  \\nNRC for Oral Health and Tobacco  Cessation envisions being a single poi nt of contact in \\ndeveloping, implementing and advancing the scope of dental health professionals in tobacco \\ncessation for addressing patient care, research and capacity building along with integration in \\ndental education. \\nThe National Resource Centre has now developed this tobacco cessat ion manual for dental \\nprofessionals with the help of 18 Technical experts from various medical and dental \\nspecialties working in imminent institutions, who have provided their valuable as well as \\npractical inputs in making this manual relevant to Indian Context.  \\nAs we are aware that d ental health care providers have several roles to play in tobacco \\ncontrol, including preventing non -tobacco users from starting to use, assisting tobacco users \\nin quitting, and protecting non -tobacco users from exposure to tob acco smoke.

The nationally representative survey revealed that 52% of tobacco users \\nare willing to quit tobac co. However the penetration  of different methods to support cessation by \\nhealth professionals remains low. Most users are attempting to quit, but without any support. Most \\nusers who are attempting to quit are  unsuccessful to  sustain the quit status for ev en a month.

Dental patients are \\nparticularly receptive to health messages at periodic check-ups, and \\noral effects of tobacco use provide visible evidence and a strong \\nmotivation fo r tobacco u sers to quit. Oral manifestations  can assist \\ncustomize interventions and boost their effectiveness, especially \\namong young users in the early stages of tobacco initiation. \\nOne unique aspect of dentistry is that some of the adverse health \\neffects of tobacco use are clinically apparent in th e oral cavity at an \\neven relatively early stages of use.  Further dentist spend chair side  \\ntime diagnosing and treating patients which can be utilized as âTeachable Momentsâ for bringing about \\nhealth behaviour change effectively. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAs emphasized in the World Oral Health Report 2003, there are also ethical, moral and \\npractical  reasons why oral health professionals can play an important role in helping tobacco users \\nto quit: \\nâ They are especially concerned about the adverse effects caused by tobacco use in the \\noral  cavity. \\nâ They typically have access to children, young people and their caregivers, thus \\nproviding  opportunities to influence individuals to quit or never begin using tobacco. \\nâ They often have more time with patients than many other health professionals, \\nproviding opportunities to integrate tobacco cessation interventions into their  clinical \\npractice. \\nâ They often treat women of childbearing age, and are thus able to explain the potential harm \\nto babies from tobacco use. \\nâ They can build their patientâs interest in discontinuing tobacco use by showing actual effects \\nof tobacco in the mouth. \\nâ They are as effective as other health professionals in helping tobacco users quit. \\nFig. 1.1: Oral Health \\nexamination'),\n",

HTPs produce aerosols containing nicotine and \\ntoxic chemica ls upon heating of t he tobacco,  or activation of a \\ndevice containing the tobacco. They are  marketed as  âHeat Not \\nBurnâ products and avail able as  iQOS, Ploom,  glo and PAX \\nvaporizers. The aer osols a re inhaled by user s d uring a process of \\nsucking or smoking involving a device. They contain the highly \\naddictive substance nicotine, non-tobacco additives and are often \\nflavored. There is not enoug h evidence to suggest that they  are less \\nharmful than conventional cigarettes and their effects of second -\\nhand emissions produced by HTPs. \\nE-cigarettes \\nElectronic nicoti ne delivery systems (ENDS) and Electronic \\nNon-Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENNDS), commonly referred to \\nas e-cigarettes, are devices which heat a liquid to create an aerosol \\nwhich is then inhaled by the user , these may or may n ot contain \\nnicotine. Process of using e -cigarettes is known as  Vaping. The \\nmain constituents of the solution by volume are propylene glycol, \\nwith or without glycerol, and flavoring agents. \\nAll ECs have three  basic components: a battery,  atomizer, and \\nfluid reservoir, which stores the e-liquid. With time, E- cigarettes \\nhave evolved from basic to complex designs with the cig-a-like \\n(first generation), clearomizer (second generatio n), mod (third \\ngeneration), and Pod Mods (fourth generation). \\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF TOBACCO USE IN INDIA \\nNationally repres entative surveys and community -based studie s \\nhave s hown the socio -economic, cultural, d emographic, religion -\\nbased correlates of tobacco con sumption. Smoking and smokeless  \\nforms of tobacco are signifi cantly higher in the rural areas, among \\nuneducated poor p eople, and the  socially disadvantaged population. \\nGlobal Youth Tobacco Survey, 2019 reports that around 8.5% of 13-\\n15 years (9.6% of boys and 7.4% of girls) currently used any \\ntobacco product, 7.3% smoked tobacco, and 4.1% respectively \\nsmokeless tobacco.  \\nAs per Global Adult Tobacco Survey -2, 2016- 17, 19.0% of men, 2.0% of women and 10.7% (99.5 \\nmillion) of all adults currentl y smoke tobacco.

By contrast, E -cigaretteâs heat liqu ids that \\ntypically contain nicotine derived from tobacco, as well as flavourings and other ingredients-  \\nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \\n49.6% of current smokeless tobacco users are planning or thinking of quitting smokeless tobacco use. \\n48.8% of current smokers were advised by health care providers to quit smoking and 31.7% of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users were advised by health care providers to quit use of smokeless tobacco. \\nCONCLUSION \\nTobacco-use in India is clea rly a big burden in terms of its magnitude and use in differ ent forms. All \\nforms of tobacco are addictive in nature due to the presence of nicotine. Dual users are at much higher \\nhealth risks than those who consume the individual tobacco pr oduct. Also, for achieving a higher quit \\nrate, they require longer follow-up. The tobacco control programs need more targeted interventions for  \\nspecific groups in the popula tion. The tobacco users should be strongly encouraged to quit tobacco to \\neliminate long-term detrimental effects on their health. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\nâ¢ The tobacco pr oblem in India is peculiar, wit h consumption of a variety of smokeless and  \\nsmoking forms. \\nâ¢ In India tobacco is mainly  used either in smok ing form like cigarette, beedi, hookah, an d \\nother pipes like chillum, chutta, dhumti, cherrot and cigar or in smokeless form like chewing \\nplain tobacco, khaini, zarda, kiwam, bajjar/tapkheer (dry snuff), masheri/mishri, and gutka. \\nâ¢ Heated tobacco products and E- cigarettes (Vaping) are the newer forms of tobacco products \\nused nowadays. \\nâ¢ According to WHO, people in the region of South East Asia use both smoking and  \\nsmokeless forms of tobacco. India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand â are among the top \\n20 tob acco-producing countries in the world. Ind ia is next to Ch ina in both tobacco  \\nproduction and consumption in the world. \\nâ¢ Reverse smoking is common in  coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh; coarsely prepared cigar  \\ncalled chutta are smoked commonly, more often by women. \\nâ¢ 42.4% of men, 14.2% of women and 28. 6% (266.8 million ) of all adults currently use  \\ntobacco (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) \\nâ¢ Only 21.5% smokers and 19.5% users of smokeless tobacco are planning/thin king to quit in \\nnext 12 mont hs; the rest have either decided quit sometime in future but not i n next 12 \\nmonths or stayed undecided.'),\n",

HEALTH IMPACT OF TOBACCO-USE \\nThe professional must be familiar with the health risks \\nof toba cco use to be able  to relate smokin g to your  \\npatientâs condition. Many smokers, especially those in \\ndeveloping countries, do not completely understand \\nthe dangers of tobacc o smoking du e to tobacco \\ncompaniesâ misleading information that distort the true \\nfacts about smoking. \\nTobacco products are made of extremely toxic \\nmaterials. \\nâ Tobacco smoke contains more than 7000 \\nchemicals, of which at least 250 are known to be \\nharmful and at least 69 are known to cause cancer. \\nâ Nicotine is classified as a Class Ib toxin. There is \\nno safe limit for tobacco use, and even for second-hand smoke exposure. \\nâ Tobacco causes immediate damage to the body, causing many acute medical conditions such as \\nshortness of breath, exacerbation of asthma and respiratory infections, as well as many chronic \\ndiseases including heart disease, strokes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. \\nA. Health Conditions Caused Due To Tobacco Use \\n1. Lung cancer: Smokers are ten times more like ly to die from lung cancer than non -smokers, and \\nheavy smokers are 15 to 25 times more at risk than non-smokers. Thus, the duration and  intensity \\nof smoking can influence the risk of developing lung cancer. \\nAdverse Effects of Tobacco Use \\nLung cancer \\nLaryngeal cancer \\nOropharyngeal cancers \\nOesophageal cancer \\nStomach cancer \\nPancreatic cancer \\nUrinary tract cancers \\nPeripheral vascular disease \\nRespiratory Disease \\nDiabetes \\nGeneral ill health \\nPremature aging \\nSexual dysfunction and impaired fertility \\nTuberculosis \\nTable 3.1: Health Condition due to Tobacco Use \\nFig. 3.4: Content of Cigarette'),\n",

Laryngeal cancer: Heavy smokers have up to 20 times the risk of developing laryngeal Cancers \\ncompared with non -smokers. The ri sk of developing cancer increases with th e duration of  \\nsmoking and the number of cigarettes smoked. \\n3. Oropharyngeal cancers: The average risk for developing an oral or pharyngeal cancer is 10 times \\nhigher among male smokers and f ive times higher among female  smokers than lifetime  non-\\nsmokers. Oral and pharyngeal tissues come into direct contact with carcinogens present in \\nsmokeless tobacco products and tobacco smoke. \\n4. Oesophageal cancer: Smokers have up to seven or eight times the risk of developing esophageal \\ncancer than non-smokers. Use of alcohol with tobacco increases the risk of this cancer manifold. \\n5. Stomach cancer: Smoking may also be related to the development of cancers in other sites within \\nthe stomach (ânon-cardia gastric cancersâ), possibly by interaction with the helicobacter pylori \\ninfection. \\n6. Pancreatic cancer: Heavy smokers have three to five t imes the risk of develo ping pancreatic  \\ncancer than non-smokers. Cancers of the  pancreas most commonly arise in the cells that li ne the \\npancreatic ductules. \\n7. Urinary tract cancers: Heavy smoking (more  than 40 cigarettes a day) doubles the risk of  \\ndeveloping kidney and bladder cancers. \\n8. Peripheral vasc ular disease: Smoking can both dire ctly cause ch ronic hea rt failure  as well as  \\ncontribute to other factors leadin g to it. Lower tar and nicotine cigarettes  have not been shown  to \\nreduce the incidence of CHD, and t hey do not provide a l ower risk alternative  for smokers who \\ncannot or do not wish to quit. \\n9. Respiratory Diseas e: Smoking contrib utes to several acute respira tory illnesses including  \\nbronchitis, bronchiolitis, influenza and pneumonia in individuals who do not already have \\nsmoking-related lung disease. It is also associated with chronic respiratory diseases including \\nsymptoms such as phlegm production, cough and wheezing, and reduced lung capacity. \\nThe Mechanism of Action: \\nTobacco fumes: \\nâ Impair ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance. \\nâ Promote mucosal and submucosal mucus gland hypertrophy and hyperplasia leading to chronic \\nhypersecretion of mucus. \\nâ Have deleterious effects on immune cell function. \\n10. Diabetes: A major review and meta -analysis of published data h as found that current smokers are \\nmore likely to develop Type-2 diabetes than ex-smokers and never-smokers, and that smokers of \\n20 or more cigarettes a day  are at greater risk than less frequent smo kers. Overall,  current \\nsmokers are estimated to have a 44% greater risk, and ex-smokers a 23% greater risk of developing \\nType-2 diabetes than people who have never smoked.

General ill health: Smokers also report higher levels of tiredness or fatigue, reduced well-being and \\nsatisfaction with life, slightl y lower self -reported measures of mental well -being, and increased \\nincidence of psychological symptoms such as depressed mood and anxiety. Smokers are also more \\nlikely to experience sleep disturbances, including taking  longer to fall asleep,  being less likely to \\nstay asleep, and having less total sleep time than non -smokers. Frequency of snoring increases \\nwith the amount of tobacco smoked. Chemicals in tobacco smoke produce hyposmia, duodenal \\nreflux and altered production of gastric secretions. \\n12. Premature ag ing: It is postu lated that smoke affects the skin fibroblasts ( cells present in  \\nconnective tissue that form collagen and elastin), thereby accelerating the appearance of aging. \\nIncreased wrinkling of the skin and alter ed complexion have been attributed to smoking, as have \\nelastosis and, in men, telangiectasia in women. \\n13. Sexual dysfunction and impaired fertility: The use of smokeless tobacco causes reproductive and \\ndevelopmental toxicity, and its use during pregnancy incr eases the risks for preeclampsia  and \\npremature birth, causes increased placental weight and reduces mean birth weight. Smokeless \\ntobacco use by men causes reduced semen volume, reduced sperm co unt, reduced sperm motility \\nand an increased frequency of abnormal spermatozoa. \\n14. Tuberculosis: Most of the cases of tuberculosis in the world are to be found in the South-East \\nAsian re gion. This regio n a ccounts for 50 lakh tuberculosis cases and 5 lakh deaths from  \\nTuberculosis each year. A causal association has been f ound between active and passive tobacco \\nsmoking and a range of TB outcomes including infection, devel opment of disease, treatment \\noutcomes, relapse as well as mortality.

Pre leukoplakia \\nInitially a âlow-gradeâ or mild reaction of the oral \\nmucosa, appearing as a grey or greyish white lesion. It \\nhas a slight lobular pattern and an indistinct border \\nblending into the adjacent mucosa. It lacks the  clear-cut \\nmargins, elevation and whiteness that is characteristic of \\nleukoplakia. \\nAbout 7% to 15% progress to leukoplakias. \\n2. Leukoplakia \\nLeukoplakia (white patch) is defined as a raised white \\npatch of the oral mucosa measuring 5 mm or more, which \\ncannot be scrap ed of f or be attributed to any other \\ndiagnosable disease. It is the most  common precancerous \\nlesion, and it occurs six t imes more commonl y amon g \\nsmokers than non - smokers. One subtype of leukoplakia \\n(nodular leukoplakia) has a great risk of progressing to \\nmalignancy (20%â46% progress to cancer). \\n \\nFig. 3.6 Leukoplakia* \\nFig. 3.5 Pre-Leukoplakia* \\n \\n \\n*Courtesy: Dr. Priya Kumar, Professor, Dept. of Oral Pathology& Microbiology, MAIDS'),\n",

In \\nIndia, its prevalenc e is 0.2% to 5.2 % and the rate of malignant \\ntransformation is higher than leukoplakia. \\n4. Oral submucous fibrosis or OSMF \\nIt is a premalignant condition characterized by sl owly \\nprogressive chronic fibrotic disease of the \\noral cavity  and oropharynx in w hich the \\noral mucosa loses its  elasticity and \\ndevelops fibrous bands, which ultimately \\nlead to d ifficulty in opening the mouth.  \\nWhile OSMF is attributed to  areca nut \\nchewing and is most commonly seen in old \\npeople, it has shown a  recent dramatic \\nincrease among the young in I ndia \\nattributed to gutkha and paan masala \\nchewing. Upto 5%â7% of OSMF cases progress to becoming oral \\ncancer. \\n5. Tobacco quid keratosis \\nIn its mildest form, the  lesion may just  be noted as wrinkles at the \\nsite of application. Among t he high consumption white and leathery \\nlesions might develop, which sometimes contain ulcerations. It may \\nbe easily scraped off. \\n6. Smokerâs palate \\nThe development of a smoker's palate is perhaps the most common \\nreaction of the palate to all forms of smoking. It consists of a diffuse \\nwhite palate w ith numerous excrescences ha ving central red dots,  \\ncorresponding to the orifices of the minor salivary glands. It  may \\nbegin as a grayish discoloration. \\n7. Palatal erythema \\nThis lesion consists of diffuse erythema on the hard palate that \\noccasionally extends upto the soft palate. It is mainly observed in  \\nbidi smokers and chewers. \\n8. Central papillary atrophy of the tongue \\nThis consists of a well-defined oval, pink area in the center of the \\ndorsum of the tongue, which is devoid of lingual papillae. A similar \\nlesion (erythematous candidiasis) may also be seen among persons \\nwith HIV  infection and must be ruled out.

HEALTH RISKS TO THE FAMILY \\nPassive sm oking or Second Hand Smoke (SHS)  is the \\ninhalation of tobacco smoke or e nvironmental tobacco \\nsmoke by persons other than the intended \"active\" \\ntobacco user. It occurs when tobacco smoke enters an \\nenvironment, causing its inhalation by people within that \\nenvironment. Smoking tobacco puts families of tobacco \\nusers at risk. \\nSecond Hand Smoke (SHS) is the smoke exhaled by a \\nsmoker (Mainstream smok e) or smoke  emanating from \\nthe burning end of cigarette / bidi/cigar etc. (Side stream \\nsmoke). Side stream smoke is known to contribute to \\n80% of smoke  in SHS. Second hand smoke costs d early \\nto India-8.1% of the total healthcare cost and 0.33% of \\nthe GDP of India.  \\nMoreover, as the awareness regarding harmful effects of second-hand smoke on health is low, \\nthe exposure remains high in the absence of any  attempts to remain away or even ask the smokers not \\nto smoke, when others are around them. Smoking puts the smokerâs family at risk. Second Hand Smoke \\nexposure increases the risks of having the following diseases. \\nDiseases in Children Diseases in Adults \\nâ Sudden infant death syndrome \\nâ Acute respiratory illnesses \\nâ Middle ear disease \\nâ Chronic respiratory symptoms \\nâ Early childhood caries \\nâ Gingival pigmentation \\nâ Coronary heart disease \\nâ Nasal irritation \\nâ Lung cancer \\nâ Reproductive effects in women (low \\nbirth weight and cleft lip and palate) \\nâ Periodontal disease \\nTable: 3.4- Diseases and adverse effects caused by second hand smoke \\nDental health professionals should promote smoke-free \\npolicies, particularly where dental services are delivered \\nin clinical settings or community-based programs so that \\npatients will not be exposed to  secondhand smoke in the \\nhealth facilities. By having a smoke free  facility, they \\ncan encourage their patients to live in a smoke free home \\nand work in a smoke free workplace, which will help \\nthem avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. \\nThird hand tobacco smoke/ Residual tobacco smoke/ \\nAged tobacco smoke \\nIt is the tobacco sm oke contamination that remains after \\nFig. 3.15 Second Hand Smoking \\nFig: 3.16 Third Hand Smoking'),\n",

The residue from tobac co smoke that clings to virtually a ll \\nsurfaces long after a bidi/cig arette has extinguish ed could prove to be a potential health hazard. The \\nbiggest risk is to young children.  \\nDermal uptake of nicotine through a childâs skin is likely to occur when a smoker returns and if nitrous \\noxide is in the air, which it usually is, then TSAâs (Tobacco specific Nitrosamines) will be formed. TSAs \\nare known to be some of the most potent carcinogens. \\nIV. SCREENING METHODS \\nMost Conventional method for examining oral mucosal lesions is visual examination. Visual \\ninspection of the oral cavity is a simple, acceptable, and accurate screening test for oral neoplasia. The \\nsensitivity of oral visual inspection to detect lesions varied from 57Â·7%â61Â·4% and the specificity \\nranged from 98Â·6 to 98Â·8%. Oral visual screenin g has the potential to pr event at least 37 000 deaths  \\nfrom oral cancer worldwide every year. Biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of oral cancer. \\nBut the disadvantage of biopsy is th at it is painful, time consum ing, technique sensitive and invasive. \\nMany effective diagno stic tools have been develope d with advances in or al cancer research. Some of \\nthem have been discussed below. \\nA. Toluidine blue (TB) is a member of the thiazine group of metachromatic dyes, which binds to \\nDNA and is partially soluble both in water and in alcohol. Theoretically, dysplastic and malignant \\ncells have higher nucleic acid content than normal, and thus, staining of suspicious lesions with this \\ndye can aid recogni tion of mucosal changes. Tolu idine Blue has been used as a vital  stain to \\nhighlight potentially malignant oral lesions since the early 1980s. A positive staining of toluidine \\nblue may  appear as a dark royal blue. The Toluidine blue test appears to be highly sensitive \\n(97.8%â 93.5%) but less specific (92.9%â73.3%), mainly because of high false positive results. \\nSteps of toluidine blue stain application for detection of oral cancer and oral premalignant lesions. \\nMethod of Application \\n1. The patient is asked to rinse for 20 seconds with 1% acetic acid to clean the area followed by plain \\nwater for another 20 seconds. \\n2. Then 1% aqueous toluidine blue solution is rinsed for 60 seconds followed by 1% acetic acid \\nfor another 20 seconds and finally rinsed with water for 20 seconds. \\n3. Lesions that exhibited dark blue (or) stippled staining were considered as a \"positive\" test. Those \\nthat stained faintly (or) not at all were considered as \"negative\" test. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\nB. Chemiluminescence is another method to detect earl y stages of oral cancer. Chemilumine scence \\nfor use in oral cavity is  available in the mar ket by the names of Vizilite, Vizilite Plus and \\nFig. 3.17: White lesion on the Tongue* \\n Fig. 3.18: Blue stained lesion after toluidine \\nblue rinse showing dysplastic changes* \\n.'),\n",

While the Vizilite Plus uses a disposable chemiluminescent light packet, the \\nMicroLux unit offers a reusab le, battery powered light source. Th e ViziLiteÂ® (Zila \\nPharmaceuticals, Phoenix, AZ) was  approved as adjunc tive technology by U.S. Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA) in November 2001.  The device emits light in the wavelengths of 430 nm, \\n530nm and 580 nm . This improves the visual examination procedure. \\nC. Autofluorescence is another method of scr eening of oral muc osal lesions. Normal oral mucosa  \\nappears pale green due to the tissue autofluorescence resulting from stimulation with intense blue \\nlight excitation at 400â460 nm wavelengths. Due to dysplasia, there are changes in absorption and \\nscattering of light. The m ucosa with d ysplastic changes wi th this procedure appears dark. \\nVelscope is the marketed product. \\nD.

This instrument not \\nonly improved th e detection rate of lesions having a p otential for progression and most of the \\nearly cancerous lesions of the oral cavity. \\nVI. BENEFITS OF QUITTING TOBACCO \\nA. HEALTH BENEFITS \\nHelping your patients quit is the best th ing the professional can do to improve their health. There are \\nimmediate and long -term health benefits of quitting for all smokers. The profes sional can extend the  \\npatientâs life up to 1 0 years by quitting.

Effect on a Surgical Wound \\nThe negative impact  of smokin g on the healing sur gical wo und may be related to the deleterious  \\ncellular effects of nicoti ne on fibroblasts and polymorphonuc lear leukocytes. Cotinine, a destructive  \\nby-product of nicotine, has been de tected in the bloodstre am and in the gingiv al crevicular fluid.  \\nSmoking m ay also cause vasoconstriction of the gingival blood vessels, diminishin g  the healing  \\nresponse. Tobacco sm oking redu ces the short -term oxidation -reduction potential of dental plaque,  \\nwhich can enhance the proportion of anaero bic bacter ia. This data makes it evident that cigarette  \\nsmoking adversely affects the clinical outcome of intra-bony defects treated with grafts.  \\nCigarette smoking has long been suspec ted to adversely  affect wound healing. Tobacco affe cts \\npostoperative wound healing following surgical and non-surgical tooth extractions, routine \\nmaxillofacial surgeries, im plants and periodontal therapies. S moking tobacco is also associated with  \\ncatecholamine release resulting in vasoconstriction and decreased tissue perfusion. Smoking is \\nbelieved to suppress the innate and host-immune responses, affecting the function of ne utrophils, the \\nprime line of defense against infection. Thus, the association between smoking and delayed healing of    \\noral tissues following surgeries is evident. \\n2. Effect On Dental Implants \\nImplant failure rate was higher among smokers, 5.6%, \\ncompared to  non smokers, 3.5%, p < 0.001.  There is a \\ntendency to higher failure rate with the increasing number of \\ncigarettes per day, 4.3% among smokers of 1â10 cigarettes a \\nday and up to 9.2% among those who smoked 31â40 \\ncigarettes a day, p = 0.059.  \\nA significant correlation was found between the i mplant \\nfailure rate and the following variables:  smoking years, \\nexposure to passive smoking in non-smokers, smoking status \\nand to the number of pack years. Influence of Smoking on \\nEarly Implant Survival Early failure rate s, prior to loading, \\nwere evaluated by va rious studies, who reported early implant failure was high (6.5% - 31%) in \\nsmokers versus (1%-9%) in non-smokers.  \\nEffect of smoking on outcomes following immediate Implant placement and delayed implant \\nplacement was also studied and found that more complications were reported in smokers than non - \\nsmokers, regardless of the time of implant placement. Smokers have a higher risk of occurrence of \\nPeri-implantitis compared to non-smokers. Studies reporting on the occurre nce of peri-implantitis had \\na follow-up ranging from 1 to 14 years. \\nStudies reporti ng marginal supporting b one loss reported a sta tistically significantly  greater risk of  \\nbone loss  over time in patients who smoked when compared to non -smokers. Studies repo rting on  \\nmarginal bone loss had a follow-up time ranging from 1 to 24 years. Tobacc o smoking is a significant \\nrisk factor for implant placement and may lead to failure of implant osseo-integration. \\n*Picture Courtesy: Dr. Kamal, Senior Resident, Dept. of Periodontics & Implantology, MAIDS \\n \\nFig. 4.1 Implant Failure'),\n",

Smoking And Wound Healing \\nSmokers have a higher incidence of infectious and non -infectious healing complications after surgery \\ncompared with non-smokers across all s urgical specialties. Former smokers appear to have a lifetime \\nhigher risk of healing complications compared with patients who never smoked. Smoking cessation  \\nfor at least 4 weeks before surgery reduces surgical site infections, but not other healing complications. \\nPatients should be encouraged to stop smokin g at least 4 weeks b efore surgery to re duce the risk of  \\nsurgical site infections. \\nAcross cohort studies, necrosis was 4 times more freque nt in smokers than no n-smokers, whereas  \\nsurgical site infection, dehiscence, healing delay, and lack of fistula and bone healing occurred 2 times \\nmore frequently in smokers. \\nThe following pathophysiological mechanisms for defective healing in smokers appear to be involved: \\n(1)  an acute detrimen tal vasoactive effect of s moking leads to postoper ative necrosis in tissues with  \\nfragile blood supply, such as reconstructive tissue flaps and colorectal anastomoses.  \\n(2)  attenuation of  the inflammatory healing resp onse and impairment of oxidative bacter ial killing \\nmechanisms lead to surgical site infection.  \\n(3)  delay of the prolife rative healing respo nse and  alteration of collagen  metabolism lead to \\ndehiscence and lack of fistula or bone healing. \\n4. Effect on non-surgical treatment of gingival bleeding \\nThe reduction in gingival b leeding is significantly less pronounced in smokers even  after mechanical \\nremoval of plaque. The reasons for such a reduced improvement of gingival inflammation after plaque \\nremoval in smokers are not known. Howe ver, since gingival bleeding primarily refle cts  the vascular \\nreactions of gingival inflammation, th e suppression of ble eding m ay be attr ibutable to the vascular  \\neffects of cigarette \\n smoking. Smoking is known to produce peripheral cut aneous vasoconstricti on. Nicotine has been \\nshown to possess a powerful constrictive effect on gingival vessels, which might be responsible for the \\nless eviden t reduction of gingival bleeding. Besides a systemic effect, there might  in addition be a \\ndirect local influence of smoking on the gingival vasculature. Thus, findings suggest that the healing \\nresponse to non -surgical t reatment in terms of  gingival bleedin g might be suppressed  under the  \\ninfluence of smoking. \\n5. Effects on surgical and non-surgical periodontal therapy \\nSmokers respond less favorably than non-smokers to \\nperiodontal therapy. Patients with moderate to advanced \\nperiodontitis were treated according to a split-mouth design \\ninvolving the following treatment modalities: coronal \\nscaling, root planning, modified Widman surgery, and flap \\nwith osseous resectional surgery. Data collection of various \\nclinical parameters was done and data analysis demonstrated \\nthat smokers exhibited significantly less reduction of probing depth and less gain of  probing \\nattachment level when compared to non-smokers immediately following active therapy and during \\neach of the 6 years of maintenance (p < 0.05). A greater loss of horizontal attachment level was evident'),\n",

In general, these findings were \\ntrue for the outcomes following all 4 modalities of therapy and were most pronounced in the \\ndeepest probing depth category (7 mm). The results also concluded a tendency for smokers to have \\nslightly more supra-gingival plaque and bleeding on probing. \\n6. EFFECT ON DENTAL RESTORATIONS: \\nLong term clinical suc cess of dental restorations de pends on various fac tors, including the physical \\nproperties of the material ,clinical proficiency of the treating dentist, and proper maintenance and \\npatient care. Understanding whether there is a ch ange in surface \\nroughness is important because âirregularities in surface texture \\nenhance bacterial adhesion, and roughened materials may suffer \\nfrom increased staining.â Increased bacterial adhesion increases \\nthe incidence of recurrent decay and defective restorations.  \\nA study assessing the effect of smokeless tobacco on the surface \\nroughness of den tal restorations showed a significant change in \\ncolor and clinical roughness existing in all r estorations when \\nviewed clinically. The t hree restorative materia ls stud ied were \\namalgam, com posite and resin -modified GIC.  This study only \\ntakes into account the effect a smokeless tobacco mix has on the \\nsurface roughness of  dental restorations solely fro m a chemical \\nperspective. Although the average pH of tobacco is m ore neutral to basic, the la rge amount of sugar, \\npreservatives, and chemical c arcinogens of smoke less tobacco have an association with restoration \\nwear. Objectively, smokeless tobacco use has  more than just a chemica l effect. The largest effect is \\nabrasive in nature. The natural stat e of the tobacco is a  graininess, which contributes to the abrasive \\neffects. \\nRecent study done in 2019, has concluded that red wine and Cigarette Smoking cause significant tooth \\ndiscoloration and color mismatch in enamel and resin restorations that are not reversible by whitening \\ntreatments. \\n7. Effect on distraction osteogenesis \\nNicotine is the main chemical component in tobacco products \\nand its effect on bone heali ng re mains controversial. \\nDistraction osteogenesis is an endogeno us tissue engineering \\ntechnique which provides an excellent platform to study b one \\nhealing and rege neration. In an animal -based experimental \\nstudy, 60-day time release nicotine pellets or pla cebo pellets \\nwere implanted in the neck su bcutaneous tissue of the rabbits \\none week before osteotomy was performed. Then a fter \\ndistraction osteogenesis, the animals were sacrificed and subjected to examinations by radiography, \\nmicro-computed tomography  and hi stological analysis. The  significantly lower bone volume and  \\nappearance of chondrocytes i n the nicotine group indicated  that the bone regen eration of distraction \\nosteogenesis was compromised by nicotine exposure. \\n \\n \\nFig. 4.2 Dental Pain'),\n",

Effect on root coverage procedures \\nHeavy smoking is correlated to  failure in obtaining root coverage. Smokers have small root coverage \\nwhich is associated with bad vas cularity of p eriodontal tissues. Th e mechanism by which smoking  \\naffects periodontal plastic surgery outcomes remains unclear , but smoking interferes with several \\nphysiological mechanisms an d cellula r functions. The larg e number of tobacco toxins may  impair \\nperiodontal healing. Smoking also decreases periodontal blood  \\nflow, compromising graft vascularization and sub epithelial  connectivity issue graft (SCTG ) \\noutcomes. \\n9. Smoking can cause patients to experience increased pain \\nWound healing can be achy for any one, but pain \\ngets exacerbated in p atients with smoking habits. \\nThe American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society \\nnoted th at ci garette-related chemicals have b een \\nshown to  negatively impa ct the w ay bodies \\nunderstand âpain signals.â Smoking  can also \\naggravate inflammation, which can boost pain and \\nadd to the difficulties of the healing process.  \\nSince tobacco dependence and c hronic pain \\nrepresent two highly  prevalent conditi ons that indepe ndently generate substantial challenges within \\nthe domains of psychology, m edicine, public health, and economics, not to mention the personal toll \\nexacted at an individual level, their co-existence will be more detrimental. \\n10. Tobacco raises blood sugar levels \\nRaised blood sugar levels have numerous medical consequences, one of which is a deceleration \\nof the wound healing process. According to Wound Care Centers, high blood sugar, which can \\nbe caused by smoking, creates arterial stiffness and narrows the blood vessels. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\nâ¢ Tobacco has adverse effects on oral as well as gen eral health of an individual and it  \\nnegatively affects the outcome of almost all therapeutic procedures performed in the oral \\ncavity leading to d ry socke t, Implant Failure, Delayed Wound healing, Staining  and \\nFracture of Restorations, Dental pain etc. \\nâ¢ Tobacco is deadly in any form either be smoking or smokeless; scientific evidence has \\nproved that tobacco leads to disease, disability, and death. \\nâ¢ Tobacco smoke contains more than 7000 chemicals, of which at least 69 are known to \\ncause cancer.  \\nâ¢ Smokeless tobacco contains over 3000 chemicals, 250 of which are toxic and 30 of these \\nare carcinogens that c ause mainly c ancers of or al c avity, oropharynx, esophagus, \\npancreas, urinary bladder and uterine cervix.'),\n",

Tobacco leaves are processed into smokeless and smoked products after harvesting  \\nand curing. Nicotine acts on the bra in and other parts of the nervous system. From tobacco smoke the  \\nnicotine enters the bloo dstream through the lungs and in  smokeless t obacco it pas ses through the  \\nmucosal membrane of mouth and nose or the skin. Pulmonary absor ption, which is the most favour ed \\nand perhaps commonest, occurs in a matter of seconds. From the lu ngs, chemicals in the  smoke are \\nabsorbed into the bod y's systems and carried quickly to different parts of the body. Oral, snuffs and  \\nother smokeless tobacco products are absorbed more gradually. \\nAfter absorption, nicotine travels rapidly and reaches the brain within seven seconds; it readily crosses \\nthe bl oodâbrain bar rier. Due to  action of the resultant release of dopamine from mid -brain and its \\neffect on pr e-frontal cortex, there is  sudden release of glucose and increase in respiration, heart rate,  \\nconstriction of arteries and increased alertness. These psycho-active rewards occur quickly and these \\nrewards are highly reinforced. This forms the basis of  nicotine addiction in an individual . Thu s, \\nbroadly using behavioural perspective, addiction in general can be understood as an impaired ability to \\ninhibit drug seeking in response to environmental information that should normally suppress the  \\nbehaviour. \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \\nAt the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the \\nâ¢ Nature of nicotine as a substance and its effects \\nâ¢ Neurological mechanism of nicotine addiction \\nâ¢ Processes that maintain addiction \\nâ¢ Various screening tools used for assessing nicotine dependence \\n5.

The role of \\nnicotine as the pharmacologic agent that maintains to bacco addiction is well suppor ted. It is indeed  \\nassociated with many well -known pleasurable psycho active effects, such as arousal, relaxation, and  \\nimproved mood. Th e fol lowing section will highlight the role of nicotine and the neurobiological  \\nmechanism in tobacco dependence. \\nNICOTINE AND ITS EFFECTS \\nNicotine is derived from the leafy green tobacco plant (Blum, 1984). Nicotine is absorbed through the \\nmembranes of the mouth, nose, and lungs (Blum, 1984). Once in the bloodstream, it is metabolized by \\nthe liver. The half-life of nicotine is 20 to 30 min. Nicotine exerts its effects on the body by al tering \\nthe operation of norepinephrine and acetylchol ine. Nicot ine provides th e pick-me-up feeling to the  \\ntobacco-users. A new smoker or tobacco chewer may experience nausea and dizziness from first using \\ntobacco. But with repeated use he/she becomes tolerant to these effects. The tobacco user needs to take \\nthe âdrugâ repeatedly to maintain the nicotine levels and the ârewardingâ experience it produces e.g.,  \\nchanging the puff frequency or degree of inhaling. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig. 5.1 Mechanism of Action \\n \\nOver time, most people need an increasing level of nicotine to produce the same response, which results \\nin using tobacco more fre quently or changing t o a stronger brand or type of to bacco to fulfil th e \\naddiction. For these reasons, tobacco experts and recent guidelines must emphasize the reframing of  \\nprevious perceptions and understand that tobacco dependence is a chronic disease. \\n \\n \\nIn the prefrontal cortex, the \\norbitofrontal cortex signals \\ndrug-induced cravings and \\nthus support the âvoteâ for \\ndrug ingestion \\nThe dorsolateral prefrontal \\ncortex interprets the various \\nsignals, showing cognitive \\nflexibility decides whether to \\ntake action of drug ingestion \\nImpulsive choice is \\nsignaled to the VTA to \\nrelease dopamine in the \\nnucleus accumbens \\nDrug Anticipation \\nIn turn produces \\noutput to engage in \\nbehavior that led to \\ndrug ingestion \\nagain'),\n",

This in turn sti mulates the reward center and is responsible for the mood  \\nelevation and apparent improvement in cognitive function. With chronic stimulatio n by nicotine the  \\nGABAergic neurons are desens itized and thus lose their inhibitory effect on dopamine.  This in turn  \\nreinforces the addiction by inducing craving. Nicotine not only caus es damaging effects, it also leads \\nto tolerance to its own action like other dependence producing drugs. \\nNEUROBIOLOGY OF ADDICTION \\nDrugs of abuse activate brain reward systems; Reward is defined herein as any event that increases the \\nprobability of a res ponse with a positive  hedonic component. Dopamine neurotransmitter has been \\nassigned the central role and regulates t he reward pathway, the mesolimbic pathway from the ventral  \\ntegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens seems to be crucial for reward. The activation caused \\nby drugs of abuse can eventually cause changes in r eward circuitry that are associated with a vic ious \\ncycle of drug preoccupation, craving, addiction, dependence, and withdrawal. There are two \\nmechanisms: that direct the reward system: \\nâ The reactive reward s ystem comprising of systems such as the VTA, nucle us accumbens and \\namygdala, are involved in tri ggering the drug -seeking behavior using internal cues such as  \\ncraving and withdrawal \\nâ The reflective system receives projections from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) which is involved \\nin regulating impulses, the n projections from the  dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC) \\nregulating whether an action takes place, and projectio ns from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex'),\n",

These  \\nactivities often become associated with the act of using the substance and become conditioned- \\ncues as they are repeatedly paired with the act itself. The asso ciation between tobac co-use and \\nother events repeated many times causes the environmental situations to become powerful cues for \\nthe urge to use tobacco \\nâ Conditioning develops because of a pairing of the pharmacologic actions of the drug with  \\nbehaviours and events. \\nâ Likewise, aspects of the drug -taking process, such as the mani pulation of smoking materials,  or \\nthe taste, smell, or feel of smoke in the throat, become associated with the pleasurable effects of \\nsubstance-use.

Increasingly, it is also used in electronic \\ncigarettes that vap orize nicotine dissolved in a carrier solvent for i nhalation (i.e., âva pingâ). Pipe  \\nsmoking, chewin g tobacco and inhaling snuff are minor forms of use.

Fagerstrom Test for \\nNicotine Dependence \\n(FTND) \\nThe Fagerstrom test for  nicotine dependence (FTND) is  \\nwidely used as a screening test for the  physical aspects of  \\nnicotine dependence. There are scales for both smoking and \\nsmokeless tobacco. Based on the score, the level of addiction \\ncan be low (score less than 4), medium (scor e 4â 6) or high \\n(score greater than 6). \\n2. Modified Fagerstrom \\nTest for Nicotine \\nDependence- \\nSmokeless Tobacco \\n(FTND-ST) \\nThe Fagerstrom test  for nicotine dependence (FTND) for  \\nSmokeless Tobacco consists of 6 items and the total score  \\ncomes out to be 10. Based on the score, the level of addiction \\ncan be low (score less th an 4), medium (score 4 â6) or high  \\n(score greater than 6). \\n2. Tobacco Dependence \\nScreener (TDS) \\nThe Tobacco Dependence Screener (TDS) is a 10-item \\nquestionnaire for screening tobacco/nicotine dependence \\naccording to these criteria. \\n3. Wisconsin Inventory \\nof Smoking \\nDependence Motives \\n(WISDM-68) \\nThe W isconsin Inventory of Smokin g Dependence Motives  \\n(WISDM-68) is a multidimensional measure of dependence \\nbased on theoretically grou nded motive s for drug  use. The  \\nmeasure has 68 items consisting of 13 domains that identify \\nseparate motives for tobacco use. \\n4. Cigarette Dependence \\nScale (CDS) \\nThe Cigarette Dependence  Scale was developed by asking  \\nsmokers via mail and through a web si te to asses s signs  \\nindicating a dependence on cigarettes. There are two  types of \\nscale, the CDS-12 and the CDS-5, each of which is rated using \\na 5-point scale. The CDS-12 is a 12-item instrument covering \\nthe main components of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 and some of \\nthe FTND. \\n5. The Nicotine \\nDependence Syndrome \\nScale (NDSS) \\nThe Nicotine Depend ence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) is a  \\nmultidimensional questionnaire based on Edwardsâs \\nsyndromal conceptual ization of dependence. The essential  \\nelements of syndrome that Edwards proposed are as follows: a \\nnarrowing in the repertoire of drug use b ehaviour, an  \\nincreased salience of drug -seeking behavi our, an increased  \\ntolerance to the drug, repeated withdrawal symptoms, \\nrepeated relief or avoidance of withdrawal symptoms by  \\nfurther drug use, subjective awareness of a compulsion to  use \\nthe drug, and rapid reinforce ment of the syndrome after  \\nrelapse. With these concepts applied to nicotine dependence, \\na 23- item questionnaire was developed. \\nTable 5.1 Tools for Screening/ Assessment of Substance Use'),\n",

However, quitting is challenging and most smokers make multiple \\nattempts be fore successfully quitting . There is significant evidence tha t has  highlighted that both \\nbehavioural therapies and phar macotherapy can help quit, eith er on their own or  in combination with \\none another. \\nBehavioural interventions (BI) in tobacco cessation v ary widely in their content, delivery and  \\navailability. Typically, they focus on, informing the us er, giving advice to q uit or a c ombination of \\nboth, using different theoretical models to achieve these aims. BIs can also range from br ief advice to \\nproviding Information Education and Communication (IEC) material, to m ore intensive programmes  \\ninvolving multiple counselling sessions. Factors that seem to prompt quit attempts are typically related \\nto motivation, such as concern over the  longâterm health effects  or the financial cost of tobacco -use. \\nThe factors associated with longâterm  success after a quit attempt mostly relate to the strength of the \\nunderlying addiction to tobacco. However, most attempts are made without the aid of appro priate \\nbehavioural suppo rt. Hence,  in order to maintain motivation and improve resilience through the \\nquitting process, various components of BI can play a vital role. \\nDentists are well suited to engage patients in tobacco cessation counselling because of the relative \\nease with which they discuss the dental concerns during the interactive chairside communication. \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \\nAt the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the \\nâ¢ Need for Behavioural Interventions in Tobacco Cessation \\nâ¢ Basic counselling techniques used for Tobacco Cessation \\nâ¢ Types of Behavioural Interventions in Dental Clinical Settings \\nâ¢ Application of evidence-based Behavioural Interventions (5Aâs, 5Râs, 4Dâs etc.) \\nâ¢ Technique of Motivational Interviewing in Behavioural Interventions \\n \\n6.

In an Indigenous \\nstudy, 44% of interns reported that they had not been taught Tobacco-use Cessation in the institutions. \\nFurthermore, a higher level of oral cancer awareness did not have a positive impact  on the perception \\nof Tobacco Cessati on Counselling. This enormous demand needs to be catered and  the professionals \\nhave to be well equipped with the techniques of tobacco cessation. \\nNEED FOR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS \\n1. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that for the \\nmajority of tobacco users requires  repeated and \\npersistent effort to overcome. Hence, it can be understood \\nas a powerful biological and social process that strongly \\nimpedes achieving and sustaining cessation. \\n2. The second is that tobacco dependence is often \\naccompanied by unrealistic fears about treatment as well \\nas the assumption that treatment really is not needed. This \\nis typical across addictions and is sometimes referred to \\nas the âdenialâ or ârationalizationâ factor because of  the \\ntendency of addicted persons to deny that they are truly \\naddicted and need help, and because they may assume that treatment is riskier than the disease. \\nBASIC COUNSELING TECHNIQUES \\nGuidance in counselling focuses on helping people make important choices that affect their lives, such \\nas choosing a preferred lifestyle. According to the 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counselling \\nconsortium, counselling is defined as a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, \\nfamilies, and groups to accomplish mental health, wellness, education, and career goals. \\nAccording to the American Counselling Association (ACA), professional counselling is the process of \\nbuilding relationships with individuals that empower them to accomplish mental health and wellness,  \\neducation, and career goals. It i s a collaborative relationship between the counsellor and their client.  \\nThe skills that every counsello r should possess include; communication skills, listening and attending  \\nskills, focusing and paraphrasing, validating and encoura ging in  a non -judgmental manner. Dental  \\nprofessionals in clinical practice with patients due to the nature of care and communic ate regarding \\nroutine dental care and plans with patients. \\nThe following explains the characteristics of counselling in detail: \\n1. Attending and Active Listening: Maintain eye contact, have a kind tone to your voice, \\nexpress interest by leaning forward, nodding. During a session with a client, counsellor \\nmust also  project that they have a vested and genuine interest in the patientâs wellbeing. \\nPositive attending behaviours open up communication and encourage free expression. In  \\ncontrast, negative attending behaviours inhibits free expression. Ivey and Ivey (1999) \\nidentify four dimensions of simple attending behaviour that have been s tudied, to  some \\nextent, cross - culturally. They include: \\na. Eye contact: eye contact is just one method of making interpersonal contact; it usually \\ndoes not involve intense scrutiny of pupil dilation \\nPROFESSIONAL INSIGHT \\nQualities of an Effective \\nCounsellor: \\n1.

Body language: Two aspects of body language are known technically as kinesics and \\nproxemics. Kinesics has to do with  variables associated with physical features and \\nphysical movement of an y body part, such as eyes, face, head, hands, legs, and \\nshoulders. Proxemics refers to personal space and environmental variables such as the \\ndistance between two people and whether any objects are between them. \\nc. Vocal qualities:  Paralinguistics consists of  voice loudness, pitch, rate, and  fluency. \\nEffective interviewers use vocal qualities to enhance rapport, communicate interest \\nand empathy, and emphasize specific issues or conflicts. \\nd. Verbal tracking: It is crucial for counsellors to accurately track what clients say. \\nCounsellors also demonstrate they are tracking the content of their clientsâ  speech by \\noccasionally repeating key words and phrases. \\n2. Questioning: Using more open-ended questions (questions that give the person a chance \\nto further explain- for e.g., âwhat makes you want to use tobacco?â, âwhat happens if you \\ndonât chew tobacco after having a meal?â, âWhen do you experience cravings the most?â), \\nelicits more relevant information and enhances interviewer control. It also allows the clients \\nto talk or encourage them or to reflect on something specific to the problem. \\n3. Paraphrasing: it involves restating or rewording ano ther personâs verbal communication. \\nIn clinical interviewing, the paraphrase is sometimes referred to as a reflection of content  \\n(this refers to the fact that paraphrases reflect the content of what clients are saying, but not \\nprocess or feelings). A parap hrase or refl ection of c ontent is a statement that accurately \\nreflects or rephrases what the client has said. [For e.g., the pat ient said that when the job \\nbecomes overwhelming, I tend to take several smokes, the counsellor rephrased it as, \\nâWhen you feel experience stress, you end up taking multiple smokes.â] \\n4. Summarization: Summarization demonstrates accurate listening, enhances client and \\ninterviewer recall of major themes, helps clients focus on important issues, and extracts or  \\nrefines the meaning behin d client mess ages.

Interventions \\ngenerally employ behaviour change \\ntechniques, addressing factors such \\nasself-efficacy and motivation (often \\nusing motivational interviewing \\ntechniques). Brief advice for tobacco \\ncessation from a dental health care \\nprofessional is effective in promoting \\ncessation. This form of advice, \\nparticularly from general practitioners \\n(GPs), leads 1 to 3 out of 100 smoke rs \\nreceiving it to  stop smoking for at least \\n6 months. Depending  on the time at \\nhand and the structure of intervention, \\nthe two types of Behavioural \\ninterventions are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig. 6.3 Brief Intervention \\n \\nThese are discussed in more detail below: \\n1. Very-brief Advice (VBA)- is a simple, person/patient centered approach that dental \\nprofessionals can deliver effectively i n less than 60 seconds if time  pressures are such. \\nWhen using VBA, professionals are encouraged to ask patients about their tobacco \\nuse, acknowledging that they may have tried to stop many times in the past, and to discuss \\nthe options that exist to support a quit attempt, that is, behavioural support and \\npharmacotherapy. \\nPROFESSIONAL INSIGHT \\nMost clinicians feel discouraged when patients they \\nare working with show resistance or have no  desire to \\nquit. It is impor tant to u nderstand why  people donât \\nwant to change. Foll owing co uld be  some of the \\nreasons: \\nâ¢ Happy/satisfied with the current behaviors \\nâ¢ They feel it is easier to  keep using and donât \\nwant to face the discomfort \\nâ¢ They are unaware of the risks and problems \\nassociated with their behavior \\nâ¢ They feel that the risks and problems are only \\nlimited to few p eople, they ar e not  among \\nthem. \\n 1. Very Brief Intervention (VBA) \\nIt is an evidence -based intervention designed to increase quit attempts among people  \\nwho smoke. It is designed  to deliver effective advice without taking up too much time  \\nor harming relationships with patients \\n2. Brief Interventions (BI) \\nBrief advice/intervention using the 5As approach or the 5Râs for the resistant quit.  \\nDentists and other oral health professionals also have an ideal opportunity during dental \\nhealth checks to ask about their patientsâ smoking status and provide smoking cessation \\ninformation and advice.'),\n",

Brief Interventions - These interventions are delivered in the form of advice which \\nprimarily triggers a cessation attempt. Simple advice from a physician has been shown to \\nincrease abstinence rates significantly (by 30%) compared to no advice (Fiore et al., 2000). \\nThe Brief Interventions include FRAMES model, 5Aâs approach, 5Râs: \\na. Brief interventions aim to identify current or potential problems with tobacco use  and \\nmotivate those at risk to change their tobacco use behaviour. \\nb. Brief interventions in primary care can range from 5 minutes of brief advice to 15- \\n30 minutes of brief counselling. \\nc. The aim of the intervention is to help the patient understand that their  tobacco use is \\nputting them at risk and to encourage them to reduce or give up their tobacco use. \\nd. Brief interventions should be personalized and offered in a supportive, non-judgmental \\nmanner. \\ne. Tobacco cessation interventions by more than one type of health professional (including \\ndentists) have the potential to substantially increase the cessation rate and promote the \\nreadiness to quit in the general population. \\nf. A study reported that incorporation of an oral examination component in the dental  \\nclinic or community setting as part of behaviour al interventions for tobacco cessation \\nconducted by oral health professionals may increase tobacco abstinen ce rates among  \\nboth cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users.  \\ng. In another study, brief intervention by denta l profe ssionals, performed by utiliz ing \\nfeedback on oral symp toms and dental treatments specifically relevant to smoking,  \\npotentially motivated smokers with respect to their attempts to quit smoking; \\nfurthermore, it promoted behavioural changes toward quitting. \\n \\nASK \\nADVISE \\nREFER \\nACT on patient's response: build confidence, give information, prescribe \\nRefer the patient to resources that will assist them in quitting: this can be in the form \\nof referral to a nearby TCC, or educate about other options such as quit lines etc. \\nAdvise on the best way of quitting (e.g., cold turkey âstop using tobacco completely \\nimmediatelyâ or tapering in which the tobacco user gradually reduces the tobacco-\\nuse) The best approach is a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural \\nsupport \\nAsk about Tobacco-use (Is the patient current or past tobacco-user) \\nRecord Tobacco-use Status\"),\n",

These have been summarized  \\nusing the acronym FRAMES: \\nF- FEEDBACK \\nThe provisi on of p ersonally relevant feedbac k i s a key  \\ncomponent of b rief intervention and generally follows a  \\nthorough assessment of tobacco use and related problems. \\nFeedback can include information about the individualâs  \\ntobacco-use and problems from a screening i nstrument, \\ninformation about pers onal risks associated wit h current  \\ntobacco-use patterns, and general information about \\ntobacco use related ris ks and harms. The patient can be  \\neducated about various dental concerns such as staining,  \\nloose teeth, bleeding gums, white patch etc. \\nR- RESPONSIBILITY \\nA key principle of intervention with tobacco users is to \\nacknowledge that they are responsible for their own \\nbehaviour and that they can make choices about their \\ntobacco use. The message that âWhat you  do with your \\ntobacco use is up to youâ and tha t â Nobody can make you ch ange or decide for youâ  enables the \\npatient to retain personal control over their beha viour and its consequences. This sense of  control has \\nbeen found to be an important element in motivation for change and to decrease resistance. \\nA- ADVICE \\nThe central component of effective brief interventions is the provision of clear and personalized advice \\nregarding the harms associated with continued use. Patients are often unaware that their current pattern \\nof tobacco use could lead to health or other problems or make existing problems worse. \\nProviding clear advice that cutting down or stopping tobacco  use will reduce their risk of future  \\nproblems will increase their awareness of their personal risk and provide reasons to consider changing \\ntheir behaviour. \\nM- MENU OF ALTERNATIVE CHANGE OPTIONS \\nProviding alternative strategies to cut down or stop their t obacco use, allows patients to choose the  \\nstrategy most suitable for their situation and which they feel will be most helpful. Providing choi ces \\nreinforces the sense of personal control and responsibility for making change and can help to strengthen \\nthe patientâs motivation for change. \\nThese options can include: \\nâª Keeping a diary of tobacco-use (where, when, how much, who with, why) \\nâª Identifying high-risk situations and strategies to avoid or overcome them \\nâª Identifying other activities instead of tobacco-use â hobbies, sports etc. \\nFig. 6.5 FRAMES (Effective Brief \\nInterventions for Tobacco)'),\n",

Use of a warm, empathic \\nstyle is a significant f actor in the patientâs res ponse to the intervention  and leads to reduced tobacco  \\nuse at follow-up. \\nS- SELF-EFFICACY (CONFIDENCE) \\nThe final component of effective brief interventions is to encourage patientsâ confidence that they are  \\nable to make changes in  their tobacco-use behaviour. It is particularly h elpful to elicit self -efficacy \\nstatements from patients such as âI know I have the strong will to quit tobaccoâ âI know I can manage \\nmy desire to use tobacco with adequate help and social supportâ and âI be lieve it is my inner strength \\nthat can help me quit the tobacco habitâ. \\nMODES OF DELIVERY \\nThe most common and readily available interventions take the form of: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig. 6.6: Intervention Strategies \\n \\nThe Transtheoretical Model (TTM) (The Stages of Change Model) \\nProchaska, DiClemente and Norcross (1992) provide a compre hensive model for concept ualizing \\npatientsâ motivation for change. In case of tobacco users, they move from being content in consuming  \\ntobacco, to thinking about quitting, planning to quit , maint aining cessation or having a relapse.  It \\nproposes that people move through various sta ges while making a behavior change and that the  \\nwhole process can take anywhere from 6 months to 5 years. \\n \\n \\n \\n Behavioural Counselling (face-to-face/ telephonic counselling)  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Use of Technologies (text-based cessation interventions like  \\n mCessation)   \\n \\n \\nEducating using Self-help material \\nGroup Behaviour therapy programmes'),\n",

Behavioural treatment approaches equip tobacco users with practical \\nstrategies to avoid and/or cope with triggers, manage cravings, and reduce withdrawal symptoms. These \\ninterventions often cover a wide variety of topicsâ including advice on quitting smoking; assessment \\nof prior quit  attempts and lessons that can be drawn from them; assessment of current motivation to \\nquit; identification of cues and triggers for smoking and ways to  avoid or manage them.

I have been tobacco for many years \\nwithout any health problems, plus \\nmy grandfather smoked two packs a \\nday and lived to be \\n90. So how  does it \\nmatter? \\nThere are certainly p eople who smoke for many \\nyears without apparent tobacco-related diseases. But \\nitâs also true that about  half the people w ho smoke \\nwill die from a tobacco -related illness. It is also a \\nfact that smokers live 6-10 years less than non- \\nsmokers. Some people are more sensitive to tobacco \\nthan others, and there is no single right answer that \\nwill fit everyone. please think if that is any reason to \\ngamble with your health  when you know that there \\nis a 50% chance that you will die  from a tobacco-\\nrelated disease?â \\n2. If I am going to die 10 years \\nearlier, thatâs okay. \\nIf a non-smoker is \\nlikely to live till 80, then that \\nmeans Iâll live to be \\n70. I think thatâs fine. Since \\nI am going to die anyway;  I might \\nas well have the  pleasure of \\nsmoking till \\n70 and then die. I donât mind! \\nâYou are absolutely right! Since we are all going to \\ndie someday, itâs important to get what we want \\nwhile we are still alive. But consider this: how we die \\nis also important. Smoking is known to cause a slow, \\npainful death due to rotting lung s brought on by \\nyears of smoking. Itâs not funny to watch someone \\ndie from a heart attack or some other life -\\nthreatening illness. Itâs a very painful thing for the \\nvictim, as well as for the loved ones. \\nSTEP 5: ARRANGE'),\n",

Query: I only chew tobacco. Since \\nIâm not emitting smoke, I am not  \\nreally harming my family or others. \\nâMaybe not, at least, not directly. But tobacco, \\nwhether chewed or smoked, is known to damage \\nhealth. Chewed tobacco, for example, can cause \\ndeadly oral lesions, including cancer. Oral cancers \\nprogress rapidly, and can cause a very painful death. \\nPlease remember, chewed tobacco is NOT a safe \\nalternative to smoked forms . So, while you may be \\nprotecting others from lung cancer due to second-\\nhand smoke, you will be exposing them to other \\nlosses. The most important of such losses is the loss \\nof your health and life, the love and support you can \\ngive to your family, and the contribution you can \\nmake to society.â \\n4. I donât want to quit, but I would like \\nto reduce tobacco use. \\nIn such cases, although total ces sation is the goal, \\nany change is welcome. At least it will reduce harm \\nand disability. Help the person set targets, s uch as \\ncutting down on the number of  cigarettes smoked, \\nor the amount of tobacco chewed, in a day.  Who \\nknows, you might still be able to h elp the person \\nquit totally in future. Take it one step at a time. \\n5. What happens if nothing works? \\nYour patient just doesnât seem to \\ncare, and you feel you have \\nreached a blank wall? \\nItâs okay! Just say âI can understand you are not \\nready yet. If  you decide you want some help in the \\nfuture, or if you just want to talk to us, please call and \\nfix an appointment.

Express empathy \\nIn the clinical sit uation empathy involves an accepting, non -judgemental approach whic h tries to \\nunderstand the patientâs point of view and avoids the use of labels such a âtobacco addictâ. It is \\nespecially important to  avoid confrontation and blaming or criticis m of the patient. Skilful reflective \\nlistening which clarifies and amplifies the personâs own experience and meaning is a fundamental part \\nof expressing empathy. \\n2. Develop discrepancy \\nPeople are more likely to be m otivated to change their tobacco use use beh aviour when they see a \\ndifference or discrepancy between their current tobacco -use and related problems. MI  aims to create \\nand amplify a discrepancy between current behavior and broader goals and values from the patientâs \\npoint of view. \\n3. Roll with resistance (avoid argument) \\nA key principle of MI is to accept that ambivalence and resi stance to change is normal and to  invite \\nthe patient to consider new information and perspectives on their tobacco use use. When the patient \\nexpresses resistance, the professional should reframe it or reflect on it rather than opposing it. \\n4. Support self-efficacy (confidence) \\nAs discussed above patient s need to believe that reducing or stopping their tobacco use use is  \\nimportant and be c onfident that they are able to do so. Using negotiation and confidence building to \\npersuade patients that there is something  that they can do is an important part of  motivational \\ninterviewing. \\nSKILLS IN MI \\nMotivational interviewing makes use of five \\nspecific skills. These skills are used together t o \\nencourage patients to talk, to explore their \\nambivalence about their tobacco use and to \\nclarify their reasons  for reducing or stopping  \\ntheir tobacco use. \\nThe first four skills are often known by the \\nacronym OARS â Open ended questions, \\nAffirmation, Reflective lis tening, and \\nSummarizing. The fifth skill is âeliciting \\nchange talkâ and involves using the OARS to \\nguide the patient to present the arguments for \\nchanging their tobacco-use behaviour: \\n \\n \\n \\nFig.6.13 Motivational Interviewing'),\n",

To encourage tobacco cessation, \\npharmacotherapy, or use of approved drugs, has been widely acc epted as an effective mechanism. It  \\nhelps in reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and aids in cessation. The use of \\npharmacotherapy in treating tobacco dependence has been shown to double or even triple the cessation \\nrates. A pharmacological treatm ent for tobacco cessation acts in dual ways: blocking the positive  \\nreinforcing effect of nicotine & preventing the development of withdrawal symptoms. \\nExperience of toba cco cessation clinics in India in over 30,000  patients (predominantly smokeless  \\nusers) adds to the evidence that adding pharmacotherapy improves the likelihood of tobacco cessation. \\nEven with established evidence of its potential, there are a few recognized barriers that impede the use \\nof pharmacotherapy in the Indian scenario: \\n1. Limited availability \\n2. Limited knowledge \\n3. Little experience with using pharmacotherapy \\n4. Therapeutic nihilism (ânothing worksâ) for nicotine dependence. \\n5. Tobacco userâs hesitation to accept pharmacotherapy. \\n \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \\nAt the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the \\nâ¢ Need and scope of pharmacotherapy in tobacco use cessation in dental settings \\nâ¢ Types of pharmacotherapeutic agents available \\nâ¢ Indications, contraindications and side effects of various pharmacotherapeutic agents \\n \\n7.

Pregnant/breast-feeding women- Motivational interviewingâwhich can be deli vered b by \\nhealthcare providers, counsellors, or Quitline coachesâaims to help people explore and \\nresolve any ambivalence about making a behaviour change, such as quitting smoking \\n2. Smokers with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease: Care should be exercised with use of \\nnicotine with patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction, experience severe or \\nworsening angina, or have serious arrhythmias. \\n3. Light s mokers/chewers (<10 cigare ttes/day), chewers (<1 sachet of SLT /day) - Quit \\nattempts without pharmacotherapy are initially preferred. \\nIndications for Pharmacotherapy \\nâ¢ All persons with severe dependence i.e., a score of more than 6 on the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for \\nNicotine Dependence Scale \\nâ¢ Past history of multiple failures without pharmacotherapy \\nâ¢ Tobacco users who are unable to abstain with behavioral intervention alone. \\nâ¢ Using tobacco within the first 30 minutes of waking up \\nâ¢ Using tobacco product/s for more than 10 times in 24 hours or uses tobacco while bed-ridden \\nor suffering from a life-threatening illness such as MI, Cancer, COPD, etc. \\n(Note: The above-mentioned indications can be correlated with clinical conditions of the patient before \\nprescribing pharmacotherapy) \\n \\nVarious Drugs Used Under Pharmacotherapy for Tobacco Cessation \\nDrugs commonly used for tobacco cessation are categorized under First-line drugs and Second-line \\ndrugs. Three drugs are currently marketed as first line pharmacotherapy: \\n1. Nicotine replacement therapy (Nicotine gums,  Nicotine patches, Nicotine lozenges,     \\nNicotine inhaler, Nicotine nasal spray) \\n2. Bupropion hydrochloride (sustained release), and \\n3. Varenicline tartrate. \\nFirst-line treatments have been shown to be effec tive and safe for tobacco cessatio n. Clonidine and \\nnor-triptyline are included as sec ond line pharmacotherapies. Choice of pharmac otherapy should take \\ninto account evidence, patient pr eference, patient experience, patient need s, potential adverse effects  \\nas well as benefits.

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) (Nicotine gums, Nicotine pat ches, Nicotine lozenges,  \\nNicotine inhaler, Nicotine nasal spray) \\nThe general principle of replacement therapies is to present  the patient with a safer and more \\ntherapeutically manageable form of the drug that direc tly alleviates the signs and symptoms of  \\nwithdrawal and craving. NR T delivers plasma nicotine concent rations that are lower than those in  \\nconventional cigarettes and thereby reducing the behaviourally reinforcing effect of smoking. \\nNRTs increase the rate of long-term quitting by 50%â70% regardless of the type of behavioral therapy. \\nNRT users were twice as  likely to remain off tobacco compared to NRT non -users four years after  \\ntreatment. \\nCommonly, NRTs are available in six forms, used worldwide. All forms of  NRT appear to be equally \\neffective; some are even sold as over-the-counter drugs: \\nI. Nicotine chewing gums (short acting) \\nII. Nicotine skin patches (long acting) \\nIII. Nicotine lozenges and sublingual tablets (short acting) \\nIV. Nicotine inhalers (short acting) \\nV. Nicotine nasal spray (short acting) \\nCurrently Nicotine chewing gums, Nicotine Skin patches and Nicotine Lozenges are available in India \\nand are described in detail in this chapter. \\nAlthough the dosage varies clini cally dep ending upon the dependence and requirement of  patients, \\nhowever the present manual has divided dosage on the basis of no. of cigarettes/bids pe r day a nd on \\nthe time to first cigarette of the day. \\nI. NICOTINE CHEWING GUM:  \\nThis is the commonest form of NRT available in India. \\nThe principal component of Nicotine Gum is Nicotine \\nPolacrilex. It acts as an oral substitute and provides a \\nconstant source of nicotine. The gum is available in \\ndifferent strengths (2mg and 4mg) and can be used \\neither at regular intervals or on an as needed basis. \\nDosage: For patients who smoke around 1 -24 cpd/bpd \\nOR smokes 1st c igarette >30 minut es after  waking - \\n2mg  is prescribed up to 12 weeks. \\nFor patients who smoke >25 cpd/bpd OR smokes  1st \\ncigarette â¤30 minutes after waking -4 mg is prescribed \\nup to 12 weeks. Chewers need about half or a quarter of \\nthe dose as prescribed for smokers. (Note: A user can consume up to a maximum of 24 pieces/day) \\nFig. 7.1: Nicotine Gums'),\n",

The gum should be chewed until a âpepperyâ or âflavoredâ taste emerges, \\nthen park it between the cheek and gum to let the nicotine  absorb. When the user can no longer taste \\nthe peppery or flavored taste, chewing should ensue once again . The âchew and parkâ method usually \\nlasts until the taste leaves, which is estimated to take about 30 minutes. \\nConsiderations while using Nicotine gums \\nâ¢ Donât chew nicotine gum too fast. \\nâ¢ Donât chew more than one piece of gum at a time. \\nâ¢ Donât chew one piece too soon after another. \\nâ¢ Donât chew more than 24 pieces of gum in a day \\nâ¢ Avoid eating and drinking (especially acidic beverages such as coffee or soft drinks) during and \\nfor at least 15-30 minutes after chewing of nicotine gum to prevent reduced absorption of nicotine. \\nâ¢ The use of nicotine gum is to be titrated by the patients as per their needs but they may begin \\nreducing the use after a fortnight to a mo nth and stop altogether after 3 months.

Because these therapies operate by different mechanisms, complementary and potentially \\nadditive effects may be ex pected. NR T t herapy combined with supportive counseling is the most  \\nwidely used and intensively reached treatment modality. Although self-help strategies alone marginally \\naffect quit rates, individual and combined pharmacotherapies and counseling either alone or \\nin combination can significantly increase cessation.\"),\n",

The  frequency of mon itoring \\nshould be determined by: \\n1. Patient need \\nThe top priority for frequency of monitoring should be determined by patient needs. For example, \\npatients with multiple or difficult quit attempts will likely require more support. \\n2. Type of pharmacotherapy \\nSome types of pharmacotherapies may require more frequent monitoring, particularly if the re is \\npotential for adverse events (for example, drug interaction, side effects) \\nSuccess story in India: \\nIn India tobacco cessation services were formally initiated in 2002 by the World Health Organizationâs \\nCountry Office and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, through tobacco \\ncessation clinics. Thirteen  clinics were initially started in cancer, cardiology, respiratory, surgical,  \\npsychiatry and N GO settings and subsequently expanded. The experience with treating more than  \\n34,000 tobacco users, primarily smokeless users (65%) showed that behavioral forms o f intervention, \\nwhich included health education, simple tips for quitting and counseling to im prove motivation and  \\nprevent relapse, produced good results. Of those who maintained follow-up, nearly one-third had been \\nabstinent at the six-week follow-up and nearly half had reduced tobacco consumption by 50% or more. \\nLess than a third of treatment seekers had received pharmacotherapy and those who received combined \\npharmacotherapy and counseling did significantly better than those receiving only counseling. \\nCONCLUSION \\nThe general principle of replacement therapies is to present the patient with a safer and \\nmore therapeutically manageable form of the drug that directly alleviates the s igns and symptoms of  \\nwithdrawal and craving. NRT delivers nicotine to address physical nicotine dependence without  \\nexposing the person who is trying to quit to the toxic constituents generated by combustion or other \\naadditives. NRT delivers plasma nicotine concentrations that are lower than those in \\nconventional cigarettes and that rise more slowly, thereby reducing the behaviorally reinforcing effect \\nof smoking.'),\n",

Maintenance of tobacco use  \\nis largely due to nicotine, which is the main addictive component found in tobacco. When tobacco - \\nusers discontinue use, an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome occurs in dependent individuals. \\nAdditionally, addiction to tobacco use depends not only on the positive reinforcing and hedonic actions \\nof nicotine, but also on escape from the aversive consequences of nicotine wi thdrawal. Research has \\nindicated that avoidance of the negative emotional state produced by nicotine withdrawal represents a \\nmotivational component that promotes continued tobacco use and relapse after smoking cessation. The \\nnicotine withdrawal syndrome is  considered to be one of the major causes of  high relapse rate in  \\nindividuals undergoing smoking cessation (Le Foll and Goldberg 2009). \\nNICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME \\nSmoking cessation a fter chronic tobacco use produces a well characterized and defined withd rawal \\nsyndrome. The nicotine withdrawal syn drome in abstinent tobacco -users consists of  âphysicalâ or  \\nsomatic components, cognitive, and âaffectiveâ components. The tobacco users experience and increase \\nin blood nicotine levels after every use, which stay for a short duration of time and then drop.  When \\nnicotine level in the bl ood falls, the  brain triggers âalarm bellsâ that compel the individual to use  \\ntobacco again. The unpleasant symptoms that occur when a person suddenly stops use of any \\npsychoactive drug are known as withdrawal symptoms. \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \\nAt the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the \\nâ¢ Nature and mechanism of the Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome \\nâ¢ Various techniques to deal with withdrawal symptoms \\nâ¢ Meaning of relapse, lapse and various triggers for relapse \\nâ¢ Prevention and relapse through various strategies \\n \\n8.

It is essential to \\nreinforce the  personâs decision to quit, \\nreview the benefits of quitting, and assist \\nin resolving any residual problems arising \\nfrom quitting. Although most re lapses \\noccur early in  the quitting process, some \\nrelapse might occur  after a few months \\nor even years after the quit date. \\nTherefore, dental professionals mu st \\nengage in  relapse prevention \\ninterventions even with former tobacco  \\nusers who no longer consider themselves \\nactively engaged in the quitting process. \\nRelapse prevention interventions are especially important after quitting and can be delivered by means \\nof scheduled dental clinic visits, telephone calls, or at any time the d ental professional encounters an \\nex-tobacco use in a pa tient. A system atic, institutionalized mechanism to identify recent quitters and  \\ncontact them is essential to deliver relapse prevention intervention effectively. \\nS.NO PROBLEMS RESPONSES \\n1. Strong or prolonged \\nwithdrawal \\nsymptoms \\nConsider extending the use of an approved \\npharmacotherapy or adjuncts to reduce strong withdrawal \\nsymptoms. \\n2. Negative mood or \\ndepression \\nProvide support, prescribe appropriate medications, or refer \\nindividual to a specialist. \\n3. Lack of support for \\ncessation \\nHelp the person to identify sources of support within his or \\nher environment. Refer the person to an appropriate \\norganization that offers cessation counselling or support. \\n4. Flagging motivation/ \\nfeeling deprived \\nReassure the person that th ese feelings are common.  \\nRecommend rewarding activities. Emphasize that  \\nbeginning to smoke (even a puff) will increase urges  and \\nmake quitting more difficult. \\n5. Weight gain Reassure the person that some weight gain after quitting is \\ncommon and appears to  be self -limiting. Emphasize the \\nimportance of a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. \\nTable 8.3: Relapse Prevention- Problems & Responses \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL INSIGHT The ACE MODEL \\nA: AVOID risky situations when pos sible. When \\navoiding a risky situation is not possible: \\nC: COPE using a variety of behavioural, \\npharmacological and cognitive strategies. If  coping is \\nnot working \\nE: ESCAPE the situation by leaving. \\n \\n*This relapse prevention strategy is useful for recently \\nquit users as  it provides them with a  clearly defined \\nset of actions to manage situations that ma y lead \\nthem back to active tobacco use.'),\n",

Its sensitivity is limited by \\nthe rapid elimination of CO, such that after 1 day of not smoking. \\nâ¢ CO levels are no different than those of  non-smokers.

For this  reason, CO may not distinguish \\nlight smokers from non-smokers. \\nâ¢ SCN is not recomm ended as a biomarker f or tobacco use because of inadequate \\nsensitivity and specificity. \\nâ¢ Anabasine and anatabine are most useful for determining tobacco use in the \\npresence of treatment with NRT.

Tobacco addiction  can be  \\nprevented and treated in a number of ways, as we've discussed in this chapter. Dental health \\nprofessionals can play an important role in prov iding these  services to both tobacco users and the  \\ngeneral public. Dental colleges and community -based gove rnment dental clinics have enormous  \\npotential to make a difference in their local communities and beyond by implementing simple and cost- \\neffective t obacco cont rol strategies, especially by delivering tobacco cessation âat every clinical  \\nencounter with a t obacco using patient  through Systems Approachâ. In this chapter weâve discussed \\nthe roles of: (1) Health  Education and Promotion Program;  and,  Schools, Childre n an d You th i n \\ntobacco control, which  are still one of the best places to target and develop pos itive and healthy \\nbehaviours in children at a young age. It is undeniable that providing cessation services in community \\nsettings and inv olving the community in all aspects of the intervention improves and achieves better \\ncessation outcomes, i.e. a higher quit rate and higher number of former than current users. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n1. Tobacco use is a huge public health pr oblem in India with specifi c negative effects on \\nthe poor or those living in rural areas. \\n2.

Conside ring the high interest in quitting \\namong tobacco users, the Government of India launched a countrywide tobacco ces sation programme \\nin January 2016 and  National Toll-Free Quitline in May 2016. Almost 40% of tobacco users who  \\ncalled the Quitline and register ed for a cessa tion programme remained abstinent after 3 to 5  weeks, \\nwith 9% experiencing nicotine withdrawal symptoms for which they were referred to cessation clinics. \\nThe 2016 GATS fact sheet released by India, further confirms the declining tobacco use prevalence \\ndue to adoption of key demand-reduction measures. \\nRecognizing the importance of tobacco cessation, the first formal tobacco cessation clinics were set \\nup in 2002, as a joint initiative of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and \\nWorld Health Organization India Country offi ce. Principal investigators from selected tertiary level  \\nhealth facilities were trained in tobac co cessation services in  Thailand. Thirteen tobacco cessation  \\nclinics (TCC) were set up in psychiatry (3),  cancer (5), surgical (2), cardiology (1), chest disea ses (1) \\nas well as in a non -government organizational setting (1). The TCCs were subsequently ex panded to \\nfive more Regi onal Cancer Centers (RCC) in 2005.  The objectives of these clinics are to evolve  \\ncessation strat egies for smokers and smokeless tobacco users, to generate experience in tobacco  \\ncessation interventions and find out the feasibility of scaling up these intervention strategies. \\nTobacco cessation needs to go beyond the health sector. The recent successful quit tobacco intervention \\ncarried out b y teac hers in the Indian State of Bihar is an excellent exam ple of tobacco cessation  \\nintervention outside the health sec tor. The intervention comprised educational efforts, tobacco control  \\npolicies and cessation support. Among teachers in the intervention group the quit rate of 20 per cent  \\nwas significantly higher compared to the five per cent in the control group. Tobacco cessation in India \\nneeds to be implemented in multiple settings. Incorporating tob acco cessation training in medical and \\nother health pr ofessional education, training of health professionals to of fer cessation advice in their  \\nroutine health care practice, disease specific counselling sessions in diabetes, TB and selected other  \\nspecialties are likely to result in significant quit rates among current tobacco users. Effective \\nimplementation of the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control is likely to have impact not only on \\nthe prevention of initiation of tobacco use but also on tobacco cessation to a large extent. \\nEVALUATION \\nThe effectiveness of tobacco cessation programs depends on the intensity of program effort and the use \\nof multiple interventions. A rule of thumb is that the more programs implemented together as a package \\nor campaign, the more successful the interventions will be. The Dental setting is an opportune time to \\nhelp patients quit tobacco. A smoke-free environment and avoiding another adverse medical event can \\nmotivate patients to quit. Thus, developing an effective mechanism for evaluation of such programs is \\nessential to establish their efficacy and outcomes. Following is an algori thm to be followed in Dental  \\nsettings for the effective monitoring and evaluation of tobacco cessation initiatives:'),\n",

Nearly two thirds of countries (121 of 194) â comprising 63% of the \\nworldâs population â have now introduced at least one MPOWER measure at the  highest level of  \\nachievement (not including Monitoring  or Mass media campaigns , which are assessed separately).  \\nTobacco control monitoring includes: monitoring tobacco use in dicators (often understood as the  \\nsurveillance of tobacco use patterns and trends); monitoring exposure to tobacco smoke; and \\nmonitoring policies designed to re duce tobacco use or exposure to tobacco smoke. The various  \\ninitiatives by the Govt. of India in the form of COTPA act and further development of the National  \\nTobacco Control Program have been steps further in the same direction. Additionally, \\ntheestablishment of Tobacco Cessation Centres has been further implemented to emphasize tobacco  \\ncessation in the various settings. Hence, the monitoring and evaluation of these systems is essential for \\nthe effective functioning of mechanisms of action.'),\n",

Behavioral counselling is not as \\neffective as medication. \\nBoth Behavioral Counselling and medication have \\na role to play in the process of cessation. \\nOn one side where medication is helpful in \\nmanaging the withdrawal symptoms of substance-\\nuse, behavioral counselling on the other focuses \\non facilitating behavior change by helping the \\nindividual to understand the \\n3.

These \\nsituations act  as triggers, which need to be \\nmanaged. The same are  the focus of  Behavioral \\nInterventions. \\n4.
